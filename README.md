# StoryTales

This repository serves as a public placeholder for **StoryTales**, an innovative AI-powered mobile application.

**StoryTales transforms children's hand-drawn characters into the heroes of unique, personalized, and beautifully illustrated storybooks, fostering creativity and a love for reading.**

As this project contains proprietary business logic and sensitive AI model integrations, the full codebase is kept private. This repository exists to provide public visibility to the project and its core concept.
